# MrZen
"Mr Zen", a Blitz Basic Amiga game by Mike Cooper

The game resembles "Harlequin" for Amiga, and features multiple different levels and characters for you to control.

Provided with permission. Code has been "detokenized" (eg, provided in ASCII). I recommend playing it without the debugger - I've had some crashes with the debugger (in Blitz Basic 2.1) but it seems to run perfectly without it. It might be fine in other versions of Blitz or AmiBlitz.
